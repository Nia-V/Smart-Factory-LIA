### Engineering is all about asking what if?
This project was conceptualized one lunch hour over a game of cards, an intersection between girlhood and engineering. We asked ourselves the question...
#### **What if we made slime for our final project?**

After a lot of static shocks, late nights at the lab troubleshooting the code, hotglue burns, cardboard, metal and 3D prints, a bunch of useless/broken sensors, and a DIY inductor with 1000 turns, we made it out with the slime. 

I'm not gonna lie, this was the stupidest idea I've ever had and the troubleshooting of this entire project probabley took years off my life, but at least it worked in the end.
